## Problem Definition Context

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies like SyriaTel, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By analyzing customer data, SyriaTel can identify usage patterns and service behaviors that predict which customers are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention efforts.

# Stakeholder

The main stakeholders are SyriaTelâ€™s management, marketing, and customer service teams. Predictive insights will help these departments anticipate churn, improve service quality, and target high-risk customers with personalized retention campaigns.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on factors such as service usage, plan type, and customer service interactions.
This model will:

1. Identify the most influential drivers of churn.
2. Predict high-risk customers early.
3. Support data-driven retention strategies.
# Scope and Evaluation
The analysis includes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
2. Feature engineering and preprocessing.

3. Model training using classification algorithms.

4. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and primarily ROC-AUC to measure model performance.
